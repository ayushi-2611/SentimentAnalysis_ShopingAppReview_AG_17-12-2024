Case Study: Sentiment Analysis of Shopping App Reviews

1. Background and Motivation
Objective:
	•	The project aimed to analyze customer sentiments in shopping app reviews to provide actionable insights for businesses.
	•	Sentiment analysis is critical for e-commerce platforms to understand customer needs, improve services, and build trust.
	Dataset:
	•	Used the Shopping App Reviews dataset from Kaggle, containing user reviews and ratings.
	•	The dataset includes text reviews, ratings, and associated metadata.

2. Problem Statement
	•	Understanding customer sentiments from unstructured text data.
	•	Key questions addressed:
	•	How can we classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative?
	•	What are the common themes in negative reviews?
	•	How do reviews correlate with ratings?

3. Methodology
Data Preprocessing
	•	Steps Taken:
	•	Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters using Python’s nltk library.
	•	Tokenized and stemmed/lemmatized text for uniformity.
	•	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of sentiments and text characteristics.

Sentiment Analysis Model
	•	Approach:
	•	Labeled the dataset as positive, neutral, or negative based on ratings.
	•	Ratings 4–5: Positive
	•	Ratings 3: Neutral
	•	Ratings 1–2: Negative
	•	Feature Extraction:
	•	Used TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
	•	Model Training:
	•	Trained multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict sentiments.
	•	Fine-tuned hyperparameters using grid search for optimal performance.

Evaluation Metrics
	•	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used to evaluate the models.
	•	Cross-validation ensured robustness of results.

 4. Key Results
	Best Model: Logistic Regression with an F1-score of 0.89 for the positive class and 0.87 for the negative class.
	Insights:
	•	Positive reviews often mentioned terms like “easy,” “user-friendly,” and “great deals.”
	•	Negative reviews highlighted issues like “bugs,” “payment failure,” and “slow performance.”
	•	Neutral reviews frequently included mixed sentiments or suggestions for improvement.

5. Challenges Faced
	•	Imbalanced data: Positive reviews significantly outnumbered negative and neutral ones.
	•	Solution: Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance classes.
	•	Text ambiguity: Some reviews were sarcastic or ambiguous, requiring advanced modeling techniques.

6. Business Impact
   Practical Implications:
	•	Identified pain points for app developers to focus on.
	•	Enhanced understanding of customer needs, potentially increasing user retention.
	•	Scalability:
	•	The framework can be applied to analyze reviews for other e-commerce platforms.

7. Tools and Technologies
	•	Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
	•	Visualization Tools: Word clouds and sentiment distribution graphs.

8. Conclusion and Future Scope
Summary:
	•	The project successfully classified customer sentiments and provided actionable insights.
Future Enhancements:
	•	Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or BERT) for improved accuracy.
	•	Analyze sentiment trends over time.
	•	Expand the dataset to include reviews from multiple e-commerce apps.
